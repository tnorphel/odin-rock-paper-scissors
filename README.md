In this mini-project I'll be implementing basic JavaScript concepts to build a console based Rock Paper Scissors game. Later on, I'll build a GUI version of it.

Concepts learned and implemented through this project:
1. Three Steps of Problem Solving:
- Understanding the problem
- Planning 
- Divide or reducing the problem into sub-problems
2. Pseudocode
3. Basic JavaScript syntax:
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Functions
